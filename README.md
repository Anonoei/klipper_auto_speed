# Klipper Auto Speed
 Klipper module for automatically calculating your printer's maximum acceleration/velocity

*With one copy/paste and one line in your configuration, automatically optimize your printer's motion*

This module automatically performs movements on the *x*, *y*, *x-diagonal*, *y-diagonal*, and *z* axes, and measures your steppers missed steps at various accelerations/velocities.
With the default configuration, this may take *awhile* (~10 minutes).
Most of the testing time is waiting for your printer to home.
On my printer with default settings (except MAX_MISSED), it takes ~3.5 minutes for acceleration, and ~5 minutes for velocity.

**Sensorless homing**: If you're using sensorless homing `MAX_MISSED=1.0` is probably too low.
The endstop variance check will tell you how many steps you lose when homing.
For instance, on my printer I lose around 0-4.2 steps each home.
I run `AUTO_SPEED MAX_MISSED=10.0` to account for that variance, and occasional wildly different endstop results.

**This module is under development**, and has only been validated on CoreXY printers: You may run into issues or bugs, feel free to use the discord channel, or post an issue here.

Your printer shouldn't have any crashes due to the movement patterns used, and re-homing before/after each test, so it's safe to walk away and let it do it's thing.

Using Ellis' pattern (AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE) is **NOT** a safe movement pattern. Please ensure your toolhead isn't crashing before walking away.

## Example Usage
- Default usage (find max accel/velocity)
  - `AUTO_SPEED`
- Find maximum acceleration on y axis
  - `AUTO_SPEED_ACCEL AXIS="y"`
- Find maximum acceleration on y, then x axis
  - `AUTO_SPEED_VELOCITY AXIS="y,x"`
- Validate your printer's current accel/velocity (Ellis' test pattern)
  - `AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE`
- Graph your printer's max velocity/accel
  - `AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH`
- Graph your printer's max velocity/accel between v100 and v1000, over 9 steps
  - `AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH VELOCITY_MIN=100 VELOCITY_MAX=1000 VELOCITY_DIV=9`
 
## Roadmap
 - [ ] Export printer results as a 'benchmark' to a database to see average speeds for different printers
 - [ ] Make _ACCEL/_VELOCITY smarter, based on printer size
 - [ ] Add support for running through moonraker (enables scripting different commands, arguments)
 - [ ] Save validated/measured results to printer config (like SAVE_CONFIG)
 - [ ] Couple ACCEL/VELOCITY similar to AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH
   - [ ] Add AUTO_SPEED ACCEL=10000 - to find what velocity lets you use accel 10000
   - [ ] Add AUTO_SPEED VELOC=500 - to find what accel lets you use velocity 500
   - [ ] Make AUTO_SPEED measure different accels/velocity to find the best values based on printer size
 - [ ] Variable motor current
 - [ ] Variable homing speed
 - [X] Add testing Z axis
 - [X] Reduce code duplication
 - [X] Check kinematics to find best movement patterns
 - [X] Update calculated accel/velocity depending on test to be more accurate
 - [X] Update axis movement logic

## How does it work?
 1. Home your printer
 2. If your print is enclosed, heat soak it. You want to run this module in the typical state your printer is in when you're printing.
 3. Run `AUTO_SPEED`
    1. Prepare
       1. Make sure the printer is level
       2. Check endstop variance
          - Validate the endstops are accurate enough for `MAX_MISSED`
    2. Find the maximum acceleration
       - Perform a binary search between `ACCEL_MIN` and `ACCEL_MAX`
       1. Home, and save stepper start steps
       2. Perform the movement check on the specified axis
       3. Home, and save stepper stop steps
       4. If difference between start/stop steps is more than `max_missed`, go to next step
    3. Find maximum velocity
       - Perform a binary search between `VELOCITY_MIN` and `VELOCITY_MAX`
       1. Home, and save stepper start steps
       2. Perform the movement check on the specified axis
       3. Home, and save stepper stop steps
       4. If difference between start/stop steps is more than `max_missed`, go to next step
    4. Show results

### Macro
Auto Speed is split into 5 separate macros. The default `AUTO_SPEED` automatically calls the other three (`AUTO_SPEED_ACCEL`, `AUTO_SPEED_VELOCITY`, `AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE`). You can use any argument from those macros when you call `AUTO_SPEED`.

You can also use `AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH` to find your printers velocity-to-accel relationship.

## Console Output
 Console output is slightly different depending on whether testing acceleration/velocity, and which axis is being tested.

 - `axis` is one of `x`, `y`, `diag_x`, `diag_y`, `z`
 - The three times after `after` are (first home time)/(movement time)/(end home time)
 - `#`s before decimals are variable, `#`s after decimals are static

### Acceleration tests
```
AUTO SPEED accel on `axis` try # (#.##s)
Moved #.##mm at a###/v### after #.##/#.##/#.##s

```
AUTO SPEED accel on diag_x try 1 (19.66s)
